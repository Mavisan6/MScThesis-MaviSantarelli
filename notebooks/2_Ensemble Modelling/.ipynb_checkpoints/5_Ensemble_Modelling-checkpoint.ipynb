    "# Ensemble Modelling\n",

    "\n",
    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Ensemble modelling is a machine learning technique that combines multiple individual models to improve predictive performance. By aggregating the strengths of diverse models, ensembles often achieve better accuracy and robustness than any single model alone. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of species distribution modelling (SDM), ensemble approaches integrate predictions from various statistical techniques to enhance the reliability of forecasts. This method accounts for uncertainties inherent in individual models, leading to more robust predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Common Ensemble Methods**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating)**: This technique involves training multiple models on different subsets of the data, created through random sampling with replacement. The final prediction is typically an average (for regression) or majority vote (for classification) of the individual models' outputs. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Boosting**: Boosting sequentially trains models, each focusing on correcting the errors of its predecessor. Models are weighted based on their performance, and the ensemble combines them to produce a strong predictor. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Stacking**: In stacking, multiple models are trained to predict the same outcome. Their predictions are then used as inputs for a higher-level model, which learns to combine them optimally.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Ensemble Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2.1 Selection of Models for Ensemble**\n",
    "Based on the previous model evaluation and comparison, Random Forest (RF) and XGBoost consistently outperformed other models, demonstrating the highest AUC-ROC, precision, recall, and F1-score across all species. MaxEnt showed moderate performance, particularly in recall, but had limitations in precision, suggesting a tendency for overprediction. GLM and GAM performed the worst overall, indicating they may not fully capture the complexity of amphibian distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, this study will prioritise RF and XGBoost as the core models in the ensemble and consider MaxEnt for added diversity while downweighting its influence. GLM and GAM may still contribute to the ensemble for additional variance but will not drive final predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2.2 Model Weighting and Aggregation Methods**\n",
    "To integrate multiple models, this study will explore different ensemble techniques:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Averaging Ensemble:\n",
    "- Compute the mean probability of presence across RF, XGBoost, and MaxEnt.\n",
    "- Weight models according to their precision and recall (e.g., RF and XGBoost given higher weight, MaxEnt downweighted).\n",
    "#### 2. Majority Voting Ensemble (for binary presence/absence predictions):\n",
    "- Classify a species as present if at least two out of three models predict presence.\n",
    "#### 3. Stacked Ensemble (if time allows):\n",
    "Train a meta-classifier (e.g., logistic regression) using predictions from individual models as inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2.3 Calibration and Performance Evaluation**\n",
    "To ensure the ensemble predictions are robust, the following evaluation metrics will be recalculated:\n",
    "\n",
    "- AUC-ROC and Precision-Recall curves\n",
    "- Sensitivity-specificity trade-offs\n",
    "- Confusion matrix analysis\n",
    "- Uncertainty quantification (standard deviation in predictions)\n",
    "\n",
    "The ensemble's performance will be compared to individual models to determine whether it achieves higher predictive accuracy and reliability.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2.4 Spatial Mapping of Ensemble Predictions**\n",
    "Once ensemble predictions are finalised, they will be spatially visualised using GIS tools to assess habitat suitability for target amphibian species. Uncertainty maps will also be generated to highlight regions with high model disagreement.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2.5 Methodology Rationale**\n",
    "This study aims to leverage the advantages of ensemble modelling to provide more accurate, reliable, and ecologically meaningful habitat suitability predictions. The rationale for this approach is:\n",
    "1. Tree-based models (RF and XGBoost) demonstrate strong performance and capture complex species-environment relationships.\n",
    "2. MaxEnt contributes additional ecological insightsand has been widely used in SDMs, but its predictions will be weighted lower to account for overprediction tendencies.\n",
    "3. Averaging and majority voting improve robustness, ensuring predictions are not overly reliant on any single model.\n",
    "4. Uncertainty quantification will guide conservation decision-making, particularly for identifying regions where predictions are less certain.\n",
    "\n",
    "By following this approach, the ensemble model will integrate the strengths of individual models, enhance predictive reliability, and contribute valuable insights for amphibian conservation and Blue-Green Infrastructure planning."
