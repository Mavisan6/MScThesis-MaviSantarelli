    "# Methods for generating and using Pseudo-Absence Data in Ensemble Modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "In this study, species distribution models (SDMs) are developed using a variety of machine learning techniques and statistical models to predict habitat suitability for amphibians in central Scotland. A crucial aspect of SDM development is the generation of **pseudo-absence data**, which represent locations where the species is absent. These data are required for training models that relate species presence to environmental conditions, as real absence data are typically unavailable. To ensure model reliability and accuracy, the pseudo-absence generation strategy must be tailored to the specific modeling techniques employed. This section outlines the methodology for generating and selecting pseudo-absence data for use in ensemble modeling, considering the optimal number of pseudo-absences for each model type.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Pseudo-Absence Dataset Creation\n",
    "\n",
    "A single consistent **pseudo-absence dataset** will be generated for each species to be used in all models. Pseudo-absence datasets will be generated for each species based on species-specific absence-to-presence ratios (e.g., 15:1 for *Rana temporaria*, 10:1 for *Bufo bufo*). Points will be distributed across the study area using species-specific dispersal buffers to avoid clustering and ensure ecological validity. Adjustments to buffer sizes will be made as needed to address data density issues, ensuring sufficient and representative pseudo-absence points (Barbet-Massin et al., 2012; Elith et al., 2011).\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Model-Specific Adjustments for Pseudo-Absence Generation\n",
    "\n",
    "While a single pseudo-absence dataset will be used across all models, the **number of pseudo-absences** and how they are utilized will vary depending on the type of model being trained. Research suggests that the number of pseudo-absences should be optimized according to the modeling technique to ensure the best predictive accuracy (Fitzpatrick et al., 2011).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Generalized Linear Models (GLM) and Generalized Additive Models (GAM)\n",
    "\n",
    "- For GLM and GAM, both of which are regression-based models, a **larger number of pseudo-absences** is recommended to achieve the most accurate results. Studies suggest that using **10,000 pseudo-absences** provides a balanced representation of species presence and absence, which is essential for capturing the ecological relationships between species and their environment (Barbet-Massin et al., 2012). In these models, the pseudo-absences should be used in conjunction with a larger number of presence points to maintain model stability and avoid overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Random Forest (RF) and XGBoost (Gradient Boosting Models)\n",
    "\n",
    "- For machine learning models like Random Forest and XGBoost, the number of pseudo-absences can be **lower** (e.g., between **100-500 pseudo-absences**). These models are capable of handling large datasets and complex interactions between variables, but they typically require fewer pseudo-absences to achieve optimal predictive accuracy. Research indicates that averaging **several model runs** with a smaller set of pseudo-absences helps avoid overfitting and ensures the model generalizes well to unseen data (Fitzpatrick et al., 2011; Ridgeway, 2021).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Maxent (Maximum Entropy Model)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Maxent is a **presence-only** model that estimates species distributions by maximizing the likelihood of occurrence based on environmental data. While this model can be trained with a smaller number of pseudo-absences (e.g., **5,000-10,000**), it is particularly important to ensure that the pseudo-absences reflect a range of environmental conditions that are realistic for the species' potential habitat. Maxent has been shown to perform well with **10,000 pseudo-absences** if the environmental data are sufficiently informative (Elith et al., 2011; Phillips et al., 2006).\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Averaging Model Runs\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of **Random Forest** and **XGBoost**, where fewer pseudo-absences are used, it is important to **average several runs** to ensure model stability and accuracy. This will help reduce variability and prevent overfitting, as these models can be sensitive to the number and distribution of pseudo-absences. We will conduct at least **10 separate model runs** with **100-500 pseudo-absences** in each run, then average the results to obtain a final prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary of Pseudo-Absence Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Pseudo-absence generation**: One consistent dataset of **10,000 pseudo-absences** will be created using random stratification based on the environmental conditions of the study area.\n",
    "- **GLM and GAM models**: Use the full **10,000 pseudo-absence dataset** for accurate regression-based modeling.\n",
    "- **Random Forest and XGBoost**: Use **100-500 pseudo-absences**, with multiple runs (at least 10) averaged to improve accuracy.\n",
    "- **Maxent**: Use **10,000 pseudo-absences**, with a focus on environmental stratification to capture realistic habitat conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach ensures that all models are trained on a consistent pseudo-absence dataset, while optimizing the number of pseudo-absences according to the strengths and requirements of each modeling technique. This will allow for robust predictions in the ensemble model, which integrates the outputs of all individual models for improved species distribution forecasting.\n",

    "# Methods for Validation of Pseudo-Absence Points\n",
    "\n",
    "Validating pseudo-absence points is essential for ensuring that they represent ecological conditions suitable for the species and are appropriately distributed in space. This process reduces the likelihood of introducing biases into species distribution models (SDMs). Here are several methods for validating pseudo-absence points:\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Spatial Validation\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Buffer Zone Validation**\n",
    "One method for validating pseudo-absence points is to ensure that they are placed outside of a buffer zone around known presence points. This avoids sampling areas that are too close to presence locations, which would introduce spatial autocorrelation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Method**: Use a buffer around each presence point and ensure that pseudo-absence points do not fall within this zone.\n",
    "- **References**:\n",
    "  - Meyer et al. (2015) suggested that spatial autocorrelation can be mitigated by avoiding placing pseudo-absences too close to known presence points. \n",
    "  - Barbet-Massin et al. (2012) also emphasize the importance of spatial validation in generating pseudo-absences.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Spatial Autocorrelation Tests**\n",
    "Use spatial autocorrelation tests (e.g., Moran's I or Getis-Ord Gi*) to check whether pseudo-absence points exhibit spatial clustering. If pseudo-absence points are clustered, it suggests they may not be ecologically representative.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Method**: Apply spatial autocorrelation tests to detect patterns of clustering.\n",
    "- **References**:\n",
    "  - Meyer et al. (2015) discuss how spatial autocorrelation can bias model predictions if pseudo-absence points are not properly distributed.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Environmental Validation\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Environmental Niche Comparison**\n",
    "Pseudo-absence points should be placed in areas that are ecologically similar to known presence points but are unoccupied. This ensures that pseudo-absences represent areas where the species could potentially occur, not just areas with extreme environmental conditions where the species is unlikely to be found.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Method**: Compare the environmental conditions (e.g., climate, elevation, habitat) of pseudo-absence points to known presence points using environmental niche modeling techniques.\n",
    "- **References**:\n",
    "  - Barbet-Massin et al. (2012) discuss the necessity of ensuring pseudo-absence points reflect suitable habitats for the species.\n",
    "  - Elith et al. (2011) show how incorporating environmental suitability can improve the reliability of SDMs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Overlap with Suitable Habitat**\n",
    "Ensure that pseudo-absence points are not located in areas that are highly unsuitable for the species (e.g., extreme environmental conditions outside the species’ niche). This can be checked by comparing the environmental conditions at pseudo-absence locations with the species' known habitat suitability.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Method**: Check whether pseudo-absence points fall in areas of high environmental suitability based on the species' ecological profile.\n",
    "- **References**:\n",
    "  - Barbet-Massin et al. (2012) highlight the importance of environmental suitability for pseudo-absences.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Density Checks and Spatial Distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Density Distribution of Pseudo-Absences**\n",
    "Use density plots or kernel density estimation (KDE) to ensure that pseudo-absence points are evenly distributed across the study area. This helps prevent overrepresentation of certain ecological zones.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Method**: Plot the distribution of pseudo-absence points and check for any spatial clustering. Ensure they are evenly distributed across diverse habitat types in the study area.\n",
    "- **References**:\n",
    "  - Peterson et al. (2008) suggest using spatial techniques like KDE to assess the distribution of pseudo-absences across a range of environmental conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Background Sampling**\n",
    "Generate pseudo-absences from the entire study area (background region) and check for biases in the sampling process. This ensures that pseudo-absence points are representative of the broader landscape, not just overrepresented in certain regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Method**: Perform random background sampling and check if pseudo-absence points are overrepresented in specific environmental conditions.\n",
    "- **References**:\n",
    "  - Peterson et al. (2008) emphasize the importance of background sampling to avoid biased pseudo-absence distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Model Performance Validation\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Comparison with Known Absences**\n",
    "If available, compare pseudo-absence points to known absences. This can help verify whether pseudo-absences are placed in areas where the species is truly absent and not simply in ecologically unsuitable regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Method**: Check the pseudo-absence points against known absence data (e.g., from historical records or other surveys).\n",
    "- **References**:\n",
    "  - Varela et al. (2014) show that comparing pseudo-absence points with actual known absences can further validate their ecological relevance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Model Testing with and without Pseudo-Absences**\n",
    "Test the performance of species distribution models with and without pseudo-absence points. By comparing model accuracy (e.g., using AUC or k-fold cross-validation), you can assess whether pseudo-absences improve model predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Method**: Build SDMs with and without pseudo-absences and compare model performance using evaluation metrics like AUC.\n",
    "- **References**:\n",
    "  - Elith et al. (2011) show that incorporating pseudo-absence points can improve model accuracy and reduce bias.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "Validating pseudo-absence points is critical for ensuring that they contribute to accurate species distribution models. By using spatial, environmental, and density-based validation techniques, and by comparing model performance with and without pseudo-absences, you can ensure that the pseudo-absence points used in your study are ecologically relevant and unbiased.\n",

    "# Clustering Issue in Presence Data and Potential Solutions\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Background\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Species Distribution Modelling (SDM) Context**\n",
    "Accurate species presence and pseudo-absence data are critical for developing reliable Species Distribution Models (SDMs). Presence data serves as the foundation for predicting habitat suitability. Without high-quality, ecologically meaningful data, subsequent models risk being inaccurate or biased (Elith & Leathwick, 2009; Guisan & Thuiller, 2005).\n",
    "\n",
    "### **What Was Done**\n",
    "- **Data Collection:** Species presence data were sourced from trusted biodiversity databases, ensuring only verified, high-accuracy records were included.\n",
    "- **Pseudo-Absence Generation:** Points were randomly generated and validated using species-specific absence-to-presence ratios and dispersal buffers to minimize spatial autocorrelation (Barbet-Massin et al., 2012).\n",
    "- **Validation Step:** Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) was employed to evaluate the spatial distribution of presence points across the study area.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Purpose of KDE and Why It Was Used**\n",
    "- **What is KDE?**\n",
    "  Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) is a statistical method that estimates the probability density function of a random variable. In this context, KDE visualizes the spatial density of species presence points across the study area (Silverman, 1986).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **What Does KDE Show?**\n",
    "  - Coloured regions (purple to blue to white) represent areas of relative density, with higher densities indicated by lighter colours.\n",
    "  - Transparent areas show lower densities.\n",
    "  - The KDE outputs a relative density metric, which allows us to identify patterns of clustering or dispersion within the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Why Was KDE Used?**\n",
    "  KDE was employed to:\n",
    "  - Identify potential clustering of presence data.\n",
    "  - Highlight spatial biases in survey efforts, such as overrepresentation in certain regions (Hortal et al., 2008).\n",
    "  - Ensure the ecological validity of the presence dataset before proceeding with modelling.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Issue Identified\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Clustering Near Edinburgh**\n",
    "- KDE plots revealed a significant clustering of *Bufo bufo* and *Rana temporaria* presence points around the Edinburgh area.\n",
    "- Both species are widespread across Central Scotland, so this clustering is likely due to survey effort bias rather than actual ecological patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Implications**\n",
    "- Overrepresentation in one area could lead to biased SDM predictions, disproportionately emphasizing habitat suitability around Edinburgh (Lobo et al., 2010).\n",
    "- It may reduce the generalizability of models to other regions of the study area.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Proposed Solutions\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Short-Term Plan**\n",
    "1. **Run Initial Models as-Is:**\n",
    "   - Proceed with the current dataset to evaluate how this clustering affects habitat suitability predictions.\n",
    "   - Check whether predictions around Edinburgh dominate suitability maps.\n",
    "   - If predictions appear unbiased, proceed without adjustments.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Monitor Model Outputs:**\n",
    "   - Assess outputs for over-predicted suitability in the clustered area.\n",
    "   - Validate results using known ecological patterns and independent data (if available).\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Long-Term Adjustments (If Needed)**\n",
    "1. **Weighting by Survey Effort:**\n",
    "   - Incorporate survey effort metadata into the analysis to downweight the impact of overrepresented areas (Fourcade et al., 2014).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Subsample Presence Points:**\n",
    "   - Randomly subsample presence points around Edinburgh to create a more even distribution across the study area.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Spatial Bias Correction:**\n",
    "   - Apply spatial filtering to redistribute or smooth overrepresented points.\n",
    "   - For example, introduce a minimum distance between points within the clustered region to reduce density.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Environmental Filtering:**\n",
    "   - Use environmental predictors to filter presence points, ensuring they represent the full range of environmental conditions across the study area, rather than just one region (Phillips et al., 2009).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "The KDE analysis highlights a potential clustering issue in the presence dataset that could bias SDM predictions. Initial steps will involve running the models as-is and interpreting the results. If the clustering significantly affects model outputs, further adjustments will be necessary to correct for survey effort bias and ensure accurate, ecologically relevant predictions.\n",

    "# Justification for Resolution Selection\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Study Context and Requirements\n",
    "The selection of an appropriate resolution for environmental predictors in species distribution modelling (SDM) is critical to ensure ecological relevance, computational feasibility, and applicability to the study's objectives. This study focuses on the role of Blue-Green Infrastructure (BGI) planning in amphibian biodiversity enhancement across Central Scotland, an area spanning approximately 17000 square kilometres. Amphibians interact with their environment at fine spatial scales, but this research emphasizes regional-scale planning, which requires a balance between capturing local habitat characteristics and maintaining computational efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Resolution Selection Criteria\n",
    "The choice of resolution was guided by the following considerations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Ecological Relevance:**\n",
    "   - Fine resolutions (e.g., 10 m) can capture detailed environmental features such as microtopography and local water bodies. However, such detail may not significantly enhance model performance for regional-scale studies (Franklin, 2009; Guisan et al., 2017).\n",
    "   - Resolutions of 30–100 m are commonly used in regional SDM studies, as they capture essential environmental gradients while remaining computationally feasible (Elith & Leathwick, 2009).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Computational Feasibility:**\n",
    "   - High-resolution data significantly increases the number of raster cells, which impacts computational demands for model fitting, validation, and interpretation. For an area of this size:\n",
    "     - At **10 m resolution**, the raster would contain ~1.66 billion cells.\n",
    "     - At **30 m resolution**, the raster would contain ~185 million cells.\n",
    "     - At **100 m resolution**, the raster would contain ~16.6 million cells.\n",
    "   - These figures demonstrate the exponential growth in computational complexity with finer resolutions, which is not always justified for regional-scale studies (Fourcade et al., 2018).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **BGI Planning Scope:**\n",
    "   - The regional scope of BGI planning for amphibians aligns with resolutions of 30–100 m. These resolutions allow for identifying broad environmental patterns, suitable habitat connectivity, and potential BGI interventions while reducing computational noise (Phillips et al., 2006).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Precedents in Literature:**\n",
    "   - Similar regional-scale studies frequently adopt resolutions between 30 m and 90 m, leveraging globally available datasets such as Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) and WorldClim products (Hijmans et al., 2005; Jarvis et al., 2008).\n",
    "   - Research by Guisan et al. (2006) highlights that ecological relevance often depends on scale, with intermediate resolutions effectively capturing species-environment relationships for landscape-level analyses.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Recommended Resolution\n",
    "A resolution of **30 m** was selected for the environmental predictors. This resolution balances ecological relevance and computational feasibility, capturing sufficient detail for habitat suitability and connectivity modelling while being practical for regional-scale BGI planning.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Rationale for Alternative Resolutions\n",
    "Resolutions of 50 m or 100 m could serve as viable alternatives if computational limitations arise. These resolutions remain ecologically meaningful and align with practices in regional SDM studies.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "The selected resolution ensures that the study delivers actionable insights into BGI planning while maintaining the methodological rigour required for reliable and reproducible results.\n",

    "# Standardisation and Rescaling in Species Distribution Modelling (SDM)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Purpose of Standardisation and Rescaling\n",
    "\n",
    "Standardisation or rescaling of environmental predictors ensures that variables are comparable in scale, improves model performance, and minimises biases caused by differences in predictor ranges. Different models used in Species Distribution Modelling (SDM) are sensitive to predictor scales in varying ways, necessitating appropriate preprocessing of predictors.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Types of Standardisation and Rescaling\n",
    "\n",
    "### Standardisation (Z-score Normalisation)\n",
    "Standardisation transforms predictor values to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. This approach is suitable for models that assume normally distributed predictors or those sensitive to differences in scale. The formula applied is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```plaintext\n",
    "standardised_value = (value - mean) / standard_deviation\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Rescaling (Min-Max Normalisation)\n",
    "\n",
    "Rescaling transforms predictor values to fall within a fixed range, typically [0, 1]. This method is appropriate for models that expect predictors in a specific range or are less sensitive to distribution assumptions. The formula applied is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```plaintext\n",
    "rescaled_value = (value - min) / (max - min)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Model-Specific Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "### Models Requiring Standardisation (Mean 0, Std 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "Standardisation is appropriate for models that assume normally distributed predictors or that are sensitive to variations in scale, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Generalised Linear Models (GLMs)\n",
    "- Generalised Additive Models (GAMs)\n",
    "- Support Vector Machines (SVMs)\n",
    "- k-Nearest Neighbours (k-NN)\n",
    "- Distance-based models (e.g., Mahalanobis distance)\n",
    "\n",
    "These models benefit from predictors that are centred around zero with a consistent spread.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Models Preferring Rescaling to [0, 1]\n",
    "\n",
    "Rescaling is recommended for models that require predictors to be within a fixed range or are insensitive to scale, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt)\n",
    "- Neural Networks\n",
    "- Tree-based models (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM)\n",
    "\n",
    "Although tree-based models are inherently scale-invariant, rescaling predictors ensures consistency and facilitates model interpretation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Handling Predictors with Different Influences\n",
    "\n",
    "### Positive Influence Predictors\n",
    "\n",
    "Predictors with a positive influence on habitat suitability, such as vegetation height, can be rescaled directly without further modification.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Negative Influence Predictors\n",
    "\n",
    "Predictors with a negative influence on habitat suitability, such as traffic intensity, require inversion after rescaling to ensure higher values correspond to lower suitability:\n",
    "\n",
    "```plaintext\n",
    "inverted_value = 1 - rescaled_value\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Non-Linear Influence Predictors\n",
    "\n",
    "For predictors exhibiting non-linear relationships, transformations may be necessary before rescaling. Common transformations include:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Quadratic transformation for U-shaped or hump-shaped relationships:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\r\n",
    "\\text{transformed\\_value} = (\\text{value} - \\text{optimal\\_distance})^2\r\n",
    "$$\r\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Logarithmic transformation for predictors where changes near lower values are more influential:\n",
    "```plaintext\n",
    "transformed_value = log(value + 1)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary of Preprocessing Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "For this study, all continuous predictors will be rescaled to a [0, 1] range to ensure consistency. Predictors with negative influence will be inverted after rescaling. Non-linear relationships will be handled by applying appropriate transformations, such as quadratic or logarithmic, before rescaling. This preprocessing approach ensures that predictors are appropriately scaled and aligned for input into SDM algorithms.\n",
