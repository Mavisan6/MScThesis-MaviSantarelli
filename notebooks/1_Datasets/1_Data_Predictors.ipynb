    "# Environmental Predictors for Amphibian Movement and Habitat Suitability\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Slope\n",
    "### **Impact on Amphibians**\n",
    "Slope can influence amphibian movement and habitat selection by affecting moisture retention and temperature regulation. Steeper slopes may hinder movement and increase the risk of desiccation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Data Processing**\n",
    "The slope data for this study was derived from the Terrain layer available in the ArcGIS Living Atlas of the World. This dataset has a variable native resolution ranging from 300 metres to 1 metre across the study area. To ensure consistency and relevance for ensemble modelling, the data was resampled to 30 metres before slope calculation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Workflow\n",
    "1. **Resampling Terrain to 30 Metres**:  \n",
    "   The Terrain raster was first resampled to 30-metre resolution using bilinear interpolation. Bilinear interpolation was selected as it balances the preservation of the continuous nature of elevation data with reduced artefacts. This method ensures smooth transitions between elevation values, which is critical for calculating accurate slope values (Kennedy et al., 1998; Smith et al., 2019).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Slope Calculation**:  \n",
    "   Following resampling, the slope was computed using the terrain analysis tools in ArcGIS Pro. Calculating slope on the resampled raster ensures that the slope output aligns directly with the desired resolution for subsequent analyses, reducing computational inconsistencies and errors in derived gradient values (Evans, 1972; Wilson & Gallant, 2000).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Export for Analysis**:  \n",
    "   The processed slope raster was exported at 30-metre resolution, ready for integration into the species distribution modelling workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Justification for Methodology**\n",
    "- **Resampling Terrain First**:  \n",
    "   Resampling the elevation raster before calculating slope helps maintain the fidelity of elevation gradients over varying terrain. Computing slope on a higher-resolution raster derived from bilinear resampling minimizes artefacts that could arise from upscaling after slope computation (Wilson & Gallant, 2000).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Selection of 30-Metre Resolution**:  \n",
    "   A 30-metre resolution was chosen to balance computational efficiency with ecological relevance. Amphibian habitat analysis and Blue-Green Infrastructure (BGI) planning benefit from spatial detail without unnecessary computational overhead. Higher resolutions, such as 10 metres, would increase computational demands significantly without proportionate gains in modelling accuracy for the scale of the study area (~16,624 km²) (Riley et al., 1999; Guisan & Thuiller, 2005).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Use of Bilinear Interpolation**:  \n",
    "   Bilinear interpolation is suitable for continuous data like elevation, as it preserves the smooth transitions between cell values, which are critical for accurate slope derivation (Kennedy et al., 1998). Alternative methods, such as nearest neighbour, may introduce abrupt changes in slope values, reducing ecological validity.\n",

    "## 2. Vegetation Height\n",
    "### **Impact on Amphibians**\n",
    "Vegetation height can influence the microclimate and shelter availability for amphibians. Taller vegetation may provide more cover from predators and environmental extremes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Data Source and Description**\n",
    "The vegetation height data used in this study was sourced from the **2020 Global Vegetation Height Map** developed by the EcoVision Lab at ETH Zurich. This dataset provides global canopy height estimates at a **10m spatial resolution**, derived from LiDAR data collected by the Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) on board the International Space Station and Sentinel-2 imagery. The dataset was generated using a deep convolutional neural network trained with LiDAR observations as ground truth data, achieving an accuracy of **±5m**. The data is designed to support applications in biodiversity monitoring, ecosystem function analysis, and sustainable land-use planning.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Data Processing**\n",
    "### Workflow\n",
    "1. **Clipping to Study Area**:\n",
    "The global vegetation height data was clipped to the extent of the study area to focus on Central Scotland. This ensures that only the relevant geographical extent is included in the analysis, reducing computational overhead and maintaining ecological relevance.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Resampling to 30m Resolution**:\n",
    "The original 10m resolution data was resampled to a **30m resolution** to match the spatial scale of other environmental predictors in the study. Consistency in resolution is critical for ensuring accurate and unbiased inputs for species distribution modelling (SDM).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Resampling Method**:\n",
    "**Bilinear interpolation** was used as the resampling method. This approach is well-suited for continuous data like vegetation height, as it calculates the value of each new cell based on a weighted average of the four nearest cells. Bilinear interpolation smooths transitions between neighbouring pixels, preserving gradual changes in vegetation height while avoiding artefacts introduced by simpler methods like nearest neighbour resampling (Chen et al., 2007; Hijmans et al., 2005).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Justification for Resampling Method\n",
    "- **Suitability for Continuous Variables**:  \n",
    "  Vegetation height represents a continuous variable where abrupt transitions between pixels are not ecologically meaningful. Bilinear interpolation reduces artificial boundaries and ensures smoother transitions, aligning with standard practices for processing environmental data (Chen et al., 2007).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Consistency with Predictor Integration**:  \n",
    "  Ensuring a uniform resolution across all predictors avoids artefacts during model development and enhances comparability among variables (Dormann et al., 2013).\n",

    "## 3. Distance to Water\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Impact on Amphibians**\n",
    "Proximity to water bodies is critical for amphibian survival as it provides breeding sites and essential moisture. Increased distance may limit access to these resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Data Source and Context**\n",
    "The **distance to water predictor layer** was developed to incorporate the proximity of habitats to water bodies into the species distribution modelling (SDM). Water availability is a critical environmental factor for amphibians, influencing their habitat suitability. The predictor was derived from the **Global Surface Water Occurrence 1984–2021 dataset** (Pekel et al., 2016), provided by the European Commission Joint Research Centre. This dataset identifies surface water dynamics globally over a 37-year period and was accessed in raster format.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Data Preparation and Processing**\n",
    "1. **Resampling the Water Bodies Raster**: The original dataset was resampled from its native resolution to **30 m** to maintain consistency with other environmental predictors.The **nearest neighbour resampling method** was employed to preserve the categorical integrity of the water body classification, ensuring that water and non-water cells remained distinct.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Reclassification for Euclidean Distance Calculation**: The resampled raster was reclassified to create a binary dataset:\n",
    "* Cells representing water bodies were assigned a value of `1`.\n",
    "* Non-water cells were set to `NoData`.\n",
    "* This binary format was necessary for the **Euclidean Distance** tool to accurately compute distances from water body cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Calculating Euclidean Distance**: The reclassified raster was used as the input for the **Euclidean Distance** tool in ArcGIS Pro. This process calculated the straight-line distance from each cell to the nearest water body, resulting in a continuous raster layer representing proximity to water.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Output\n",
    "The resulting distance to water raster was exported in **GeoTIFF format** for integration into the SDM. This predictor layer provides valuable spatial information on habitat accessibility to water bodies, aiding in the identification of suitable areas for amphibian conservation and planning.\n",

    "To enhance the environmental predictors used in the species distribution modelling, NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) data were processed to represent both the median values and the standard deviation over the study period. NDVI is a critical indicator of vegetation health and distribution, which significantly impacts habitat suitability for amphibians.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Data Source and Preprocessing**\n",
    "The Sentinel-2 satellite imagery from the Copernicus programme was used as the source dataset, covering the period from April 2019 to October 2024. Sentinel-2 Level-2A data provides surface reflectance values with high spatial resolution (10m for visible bands). The dataset was filtered to include only images with less than 10% cloud cover and clipped to the study area.\n",
    "\n",
    "A cloud masking algorithm was applied using the Sentinel-2 Scene Classification Layer (SCL) to remove cloud, shadow, and snow pixels, ensuring the integrity of the data. This step minimized noise and preserved only reliable reflectance values for NDVI calculations.\n",

    "\n",
    "The following two metrics were derived from the NDVI collection:\n",
    "1. **NDVI Median:** The median NDVI value was computed to represent the central tendency of vegetation greenness during the study period, reflecting typical vegetation conditions.\n",
    "2. **NDVI Standard Deviation:** The standard deviation of NDVI values was calculated to capture temporal variability in vegetation, highlighting areas with dynamic vegetation patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Output and Use**\n",
    "Both NDVI metrics were exported as raster layers with a spatial resolution of 30m, using bilinear resampling to align with the resolution of other predictors in the model. The rasters were re-projected to the British National Grid (OSGB 1936), ensuring compatibility with the modelling environment.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Impact on Amphibians\n",
    "The presence of grasslands can facilitate movement and provide suitable foraging habitats for many amphibian species.  \n",
    "Grassland habitats play a critical role in supporting amphibian populations by providing essential resources such as foraging opportunities, shelter, and movement corridors. Amphibians are known to utilise different habitat types during various stages of their life cycle. While aquatic habitats are crucial for breeding, terrestrial habitats, including grasslands, are equally important for their post-breeding dispersal and foraging activities (Beebee & Griffiths, 2005; Cushman, 2006).\n",
    "\n",
    "The presence of grasslands in the vicinity of breeding sites enhances habitat connectivity, reduces desiccation risks, and increases food availability, thereby facilitating amphibian movement across fragmented landscapes (Semlitsch & Bodie, 2003). Furthermore, grasslands with high vegetation cover can mitigate predation risks and provide microclimatic conditions favourable for amphibians, which are highly sensitive to moisture and temperature variations (Hamer & McDonnell, 2008).\n",
    "\n",
    "By analysing the **density of grasslands** within a **250m neighbourhood radius** around each cell, this predictor layer captures the potential terrestrial habitat quality surrounding amphibian habitats and facilitates an assessment of landscape permeability for amphibian movement. The 250m distance is based on ecological studies indicating that many amphibian species exhibit limited terrestrial dispersal distances, typically ranging between 100m and 500m from breeding sites (Jehle et al., 2011). This makes grassland density within a 250m radius a relevant predictor for species distribution models.\n",

    "## 7. Distance to Forest\n",
    "### Impact on Amphibians\n",
    "Forests can serve as essential corridors for amphibian movement, providing shelter and moisture retention, thus influencing habitat selection. Forested areas serve as critical corridors for amphibian movement by providing shelter, moisture retention, and protection from predators. These factors are particularly important during post-breeding migrations and dispersal phases, as amphibians are highly sensitive to desiccation and environmental fluctuations (Beebee & Griffiths, 2005; Cushman, 2006). The proximity to forested areas can influence amphibian habitat selection and survival, making **distance to the nearest forest** a key predictor in species distribution modelling (SDM) (Semlitsch & Bodie, 2003; Hartel et al., 2010).\n",

    "- The **EUNIS NatureScot Land Cover Map 2022** was used as the primary data source for identifying forested areas in central Scotland.\n",

    "  - **0** for non-forested areas.\n",
    "- The resulting binary raster (`Woodland_Binary.tif`) was saved for further processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **3. Extracting Woodland Areas**\n",
    "- To ensure accurate distance calculations, the **Extract by Attributes Tool** was used to extract only the woodland cells where the value = 1.\n",
    "- This step resulted in a raster (`Extracted_Woodland.tif`) containing only forested areas, with all non-forested areas set to **NoData**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **4. Calculating Distance to Woodland**\n",

Calculating **Euclidean distance** from each cell to the nearest forest allows us to quantify the accessibility of these critical habitats for amphibians across the landscape. Euclidean distance has been widely used in ecological modelling to assess proximity-based habitat effects (Cushman, 2006; Hartel et al., 2010).\n",

    "Urbanisation significantly alters natural landscapes, affecting amphibian populations by fragmenting habitats, increasing impermeable surfaces, and creating barriers to movement (Cushman, 2006; Hamer & McDonnell, 2008). Built-up areas reduce habitat permeability and increase desiccation risks, which is critical for amphibians that rely on moist environments for survival and dispersal. Therefore, quantifying **average building density within a 250m neighbourhood radius** is essential to assess the impact of urbanisation on amphibian habitat suitability and movement patterns.\n",
