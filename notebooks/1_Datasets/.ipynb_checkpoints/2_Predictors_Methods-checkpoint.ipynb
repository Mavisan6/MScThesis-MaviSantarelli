    "\n",
    "## 1. Slope\n",
    "### **Impact on Amphibians**\n",
    "Slope can influence amphibian movement and habitat selection by affecting moisture retention and temperature regulation. Steeper slopes may hinder movement and increase the risk of desiccation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Data Processing**\n",
    "The slope data for this study was derived from the Terrain layer available in the ArcGIS Living Atlas of the World. This dataset has a variable native resolution ranging from 300 metres to 1 metre across the study area. To ensure consistency and relevance for ensemble modelling, the data was resampled to 30 metres before slope calculation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Workflow\n",
    "1. **Resampling Terrain to 30 Metres**:  \n",
    "   The Terrain raster was first resampled to 30-metre resolution using bilinear interpolation. Bilinear interpolation was selected as it balances the preservation of the continuous nature of elevation data with reduced artefacts. This method ensures smooth transitions between elevation values, which is critical for calculating accurate slope values (Kennedy et al., 1998; Smith et al., 2019).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Slope Calculation**:  \n",
    "   Following resampling, the slope was computed using the terrain analysis tools in ArcGIS Pro. Calculating slope on the resampled raster ensures that the slope output aligns directly with the desired resolution for subsequent analyses, reducing computational inconsistencies and errors in derived gradient values (Evans, 1972; Wilson & Gallant, 2000).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Export for Analysis**:  \n",
    "   The processed slope raster was exported at 30-metre resolution, ready for integration into the species distribution modelling workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Justification for Methodology**\n",
    "- **Resampling Terrain First**:  \n",
    "   Resampling the elevation raster before calculating slope helps maintain the fidelity of elevation gradients over varying terrain. Computing slope on a higher-resolution raster derived from bilinear resampling minimizes artefacts that could arise from upscaling after slope computation (Wilson & Gallant, 2000).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Selection of 30-Metre Resolution**:  \n",
    "   A 30-metre resolution was chosen to balance computational efficiency with ecological relevance. Amphibian habitat analysis and Blue-Green Infrastructure (BGI) planning benefit from spatial detail without unnecessary computational overhead. Higher resolutions, such as 10 metres, would increase computational demands significantly without proportionate gains in modelling accuracy for the scale of the study area (~16,624 km²) (Riley et al., 1999; Guisan & Thuiller, 2005).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Use of Bilinear Interpolation**:  \n",
    "   Bilinear interpolation is suitable for continuous data like elevation, as it preserves the smooth transitions between cell values, which are critical for accurate slope derivation (Kennedy et al., 1998). Alternative methods, such as nearest neighbour, may introduce abrupt changes in slope values, reducing ecological validity.\n",

    "### **Data Processing**\n",
    "### Workflow\n",
    "1. **Clipping to Study Area**:\n",
    "The global vegetation height data was clipped to the extent of the study area to focus on Central Scotland. This ensures that only the relevant geographical extent is included in the analysis, reducing computational overhead and maintaining ecological relevance.\n",

    "2. **Resampling to 30m Resolution**:\n",
    "The original 10m resolution data was resampled to a **30m resolution** to match the spatial scale of other environmental predictors in the study. Consistency in resolution is critical for ensuring accurate and unbiased inputs for species distribution modelling (SDM).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Resampling Method**:\n",
    "**Bilinear interpolation** was used as the resampling method. This approach is well-suited for continuous data like vegetation height, as it calculates the value of each new cell based on a weighted average of the four nearest cells. Bilinear interpolation smooths transitions between neighbouring pixels, preserving gradual changes in vegetation height while avoiding artefacts introduced by simpler methods like nearest neighbour resampling (Chen et al., 2007; Hijmans et al., 2005).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Justification for Resampling Method\n",
    "- **Suitability for Continuous Variables**:  \n",
    "  Vegetation height represents a continuous variable where abrupt transitions between pixels are not ecologically meaningful. Bilinear interpolation reduces artificial boundaries and ensures smoother transitions, aligning with standard practices for processing environmental data (Chen et al., 2007).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Consistency with Predictor Integration**:  \n",

    "A cloud masking algorithm was applied using the Sentinel-2 Scene Classification Layer (SCL) to remove cloud, shadow, and snow pixels, ensuring the integrity of the data. This step minimized noise and preserved only reliable reflectance values for NDVI calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **NDVI Calculation and Metrics**\n",
    "NDVI was calculated for each image in the filtered collection using the formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\text{NDVI} = \\frac{\\text{NIR} - \\text{Red}}{\\text{NIR} + \\text{Red}} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where the Near Infrared (NIR) band corresponds to Band 8, and the Red band corresponds to Band 4. \n",
    "\n",
    "The following two metrics were derived from the NDVI collection:\n",
    "1. **NDVI Median:** The median NDVI value was computed to represent the central tendency of vegetation greenness during the study period, reflecting typical vegetation conditions.\n",
    "2. **NDVI Standard Deviation:** The standard deviation of NDVI values was calculated to capture temporal variability in vegetation, highlighting areas with dynamic vegetation patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Output and Use**\n",
    "Both NDVI metrics were exported as raster layers with a spatial resolution of 30m, using bilinear resampling to align with the resolution of other predictors in the model. The rasters were re-projected to the British National Grid (OSGB 1936), ensuring compatibility with the modelling environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "These layers will serve as key predictors in the ensemble modelling framework, providing insights into the role of vegetation distribution and variability in shaping amphibian habitat suitability. This step is critical for linking vegetation dynamics to ecological processes relevant to Blue-Green Infrastructure (BGI) planning in Central Scotland.\n"

    "## 5. Runoff Coefficient\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Impact on Amphibians**\n",
    "The runoff coefficient (C) is a critical measure of the imperviousness of land cover, influencing hydrological processes such as infiltration, surface runoff, and water retention. Amphibians are highly dependent on water availability for breeding and foraging, making the runoff coefficient an important predictor in species distribution modelling. High imperviousness can reduce habitat suitability by increasing surface runoff, which leads to faster water drainage, habitat desiccation, and loss of breeding sites.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Data Processing**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **1. Data Acquisition**\n",
    "The runoff coefficient values were derived from the study by *Di Giustino et al.* and tailored to match the land cover classes available in the EUNIS habitat map. These coefficients quantify the proportion of precipitation that becomes surface runoff for each land cover type. Additionally, for water bodies, the value of **0.001** was used, following *Donati et al.*, as a proxy for imperviousness to represent the hydrological impacts of urbanisation on natural catchments.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2. Reclassification**\n",
    "The EUNIS habitat map, initially provided as a raster dataset, was processed to assign runoff coefficients based on the table below. The reclassification process preserved the integrity of land cover types and their ecological relevance.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **3. Runoff Coefficient Assignment**\n",
    "Runoff coefficients were assigned to each EUNIS land cover class using a reclassification approach in ArcGIS Pro. Specific values were selected based on a review of the study by *Di Giustino et al.*, with adjustments for ecological relevance and amphibian habitat considerations. The table below summarises the coefficients and their rationale:\n",

    "\n",
    "### Impact on Amphibians\n",
    "The presence of grasslands can facilitate movement and provide suitable foraging habitats for many amphibian species.  \n",
    "Grassland habitats play a critical role in supporting amphibian populations by providing essential resources such as foraging opportunities, shelter, and movement corridors. Amphibians are known to utilise different habitat types during various stages of their life cycle. While aquatic habitats are crucial for breeding, terrestrial habitats, including grasslands, are equally important for their post-breeding dispersal and foraging activities (Beebee & Griffiths, 2005; Cushman, 2006).\n",
    "\n",
    "The presence of grasslands in the vicinity of breeding sites enhances habitat connectivity, reduces desiccation risks, and increases food availability, thereby facilitating amphibian movement across fragmented landscapes (Semlitsch & Bodie, 2003). Furthermore, grasslands with high vegetation cover can mitigate predation risks and provide microclimatic conditions favourable for amphibians, which are highly sensitive to moisture and temperature variations (Hamer & McDonnell, 2008).\n",
    "\n",
    "By analysing the **density of grasslands** within a **250m neighbourhood radius** around each cell, this predictor layer captures the potential terrestrial habitat quality surrounding amphibian habitats and facilitates an assessment of landscape permeability for amphibian movement. The 250m distance is based on ecological studies indicating that many amphibian species exhibit limited terrestrial dispersal distances, typically ranging between 100m and 500m from breeding sites (Jehle et al., 2011). This makes grassland density within a 250m radius a relevant predictor for species distribution models.\n",

    "Forests can serve as essential corridors for amphibian movement, providing shelter and moisture retention, thus influencing habitat selection. Forested areas serve as critical corridors for amphibian movement by providing shelter, moisture retention, and protection from predators. These factors are particularly important during post-breeding migrations and dispersal phases, as amphibians are highly sensitive to desiccation and environmental fluctuations (Beebee & Griffiths, 2005; Cushman, 2006). The proximity to forested areas can influence amphibian habitat selection and survival, making **distance to the nearest forest** a key predictor in species distribution modelling (SDM) (Semlitsch & Bodie, 2003; Hartel et al., 2010).\n",

    "\n",
    "### Importance for Amphibians\n",
    "Amphibians are highly susceptible to environmental pollution due to their permeable skin, which facilitates direct chemical absorption from the environment. Among various pollutants, **nitrogen oxides (NOx)** have been shown to directly impact amphibian populations by altering their aquatic habitats.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Aquatic Habitat Degradation**: NOx contributes to acid rain, which acidifies aquatic habitats, reducing breeding success and larval survival. Amphibians exposed to low pH environments experience higher mortality rates and developmental issues (Beebee & Griffiths, 2005).\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the significant role of pollution in shaping amphibian distributions, the inclusion of NOx as a pollution predictor in species distribution modelling (SDM) provides a more accurate representation of environmental pressures.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Process to Create Pollution Predictors\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Data Acquisition**\n",
    "Pollution data for **NOx** was obtained from the [Scottish Air Quality Mapping Data](https://www.scottishairquality.scot/data/mapping/data). NOx was selected based on its well-documented impacts on amphibians as described in the literature. The dataset provided annual average concentrations across Scotland, ensuring comprehensive coverage of the study area.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Data Processing**\n",
    "The NOx dataset was processed using ArcGIS Pro to create a standardised predictor layer for inclusion in the SDM. The following steps were undertaken:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Loading Data into GIS**:  \n",
    "   The NOx dataset was imported into ArcGIS Pro. The extent of the dataset was inspected to confirm that it fully covered the study area. Since the data was initially in a geographic coordinate system (WGS84), it was reprojected to **British National Grid (EPSG:27700)** to maintain consistency with other spatial predictors.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Interpolating Point Data Using IDW**:  \n",
    "   Since the NOx dataset consisted of point measurements, an interpolated surface was created using the **Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW)** tool. IDW was selected for its efficiency in generating smooth, continuous surfaces from point data. The following parameters were applied:\n",
    "   - **Power**: 2 (default value, emphasising nearby points)\n",
    "   - **Cell size**: 30m (to match the resolution of other predictors)\n",
    "   - **Search radius**: Variable, including 12 nearest points\n",
    "   The output of the IDW interpolation was saved as `NOx_Interpolated.tif`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Clipping to Study Area**:  \n",
    "   The interpolated pollution dataset was clipped to the study area boundary using the **Clip Raster Tool**. This step ensured that only data relevant to the study area was retained, thereby improving computational efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Resampling to Standard Resolution**:  \n",
    "   To ensure uniform spatial resolution across all predictors, the clipped NOx raster was resampled to a **30m cell size** using the **Resample Tool**. Bilinear interpolation was applied to preserve the continuous nature of pollution data. This resolution was chosen to match other environmental predictors and maintain a balance between spatial detail and computational feasibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Standardisation**:  \n",
    "   The NOx raster was standardised to a **0–1 range** to facilitate comparison with other predictors. This process involved applying the following normalisation formula in the **Raster Calculator**:\n",
    "   ```plaintext\n",
    "   (\"NOx_Interpolated\" - in_value) / (max_value - min_value)\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   where `min_value` and `max_value` represent the minimum and maximum NOx concentrations in the dataset. The resulting raster was saved as `Standardised_NOx.tif`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Output\n",
    "The final output consisted of a standardised raster layer representing the relative concentrations of **NOx** within the study area. The layer contained values ranging from **0** (low pollution) to **1** (high pollution). This layer serves as a continuous predictor for modelling amphibian distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rationale\n",
    "Nitrogen oxides (**NOx**) were selected as a key pollution predictor due to their known role in altering amphibian habitats. NOx contributes to acidification of aquatic habitats, which directly impacts amphibian reproductive success and larval development (Beebee & Griffiths, 2005). Including NOx in the SDM enables the model to account for spatial variability in anthropogenic pressures, improving its accuracy in predicting suitable habitats for amphibians.\n",

    "## 11. Soil Moisture Variability\n",
    "\n",
    "### Importance for Amphibians\n",
    "Amphibians are highly sensitive to changes in moisture levels due to their permeable skin and reliance on moist environments for hydration and movement. Soil moisture plays a critical role in amphibian habitat suitability, particularly during terrestrial phases of their life cycle. Variability in soil moisture can lead to desiccation risks and reduced habitat connectivity, ultimately impacting amphibian populations (Rittenhouse et al., 2008; Ousterhout & Semlitsch, 2018).\n",
    "\n",
    "Projected increases in climate variability may exacerbate soil moisture fluctuations, making it essential to include this predictor in species distribution models (SDMs) to assess habitat suitability under future climatic conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Summary of the Process to Create the Predictor Layer**\n",
    "\n",
    "The soil moisture variability predictor layer was generated to assess the temporal fluctuations in soil moisture across the study area, an important factor influencing amphibian habitat suitability. Amphibians are particularly sensitive to changes in soil moisture due to their permeable skin and reliance on moist environments during terrestrial life stages (Rittenhouse et al., 2008; Ousterhout & Semlitsch, 2018). This layer provides critical information for species distribution modelling (SDM) by accounting for the spatial heterogeneity of moisture availability.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Source\n",
    "\n",
    "Soil moisture data was obtained from the **ERA5-Land dataset**, which provides high-resolution (0.1° x 0.1°) reanalysis data on various land variables, including soil moisture, across long temporal scales (Copernicus Climate Change Service, 2021). The dataset contains volumetric soil water content for four depth layers, with the topmost layer (0–7 cm) selected for this analysis to represent surface soil moisture most relevant to amphibians.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Processing\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **1. Interpolation**\n",
    "The downloaded ERA5-Land data was provided as a GRIB file containing multiple time steps over the study period. Initially, the soil moisture data was interpolated across the entire study area using Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW), a common spatial interpolation method for continuous environmental variables (Li & Heap, 2011). The interpolation ensured spatial continuity in the resulting raster, covering the entire study area.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2. Temporal Variability Calculation**\n",
    "Temporal variability was calculated by computing the standard deviation of soil moisture across all time steps (monthly data spanning 10 years). This method captures the degree of fluctuation in soil moisture over time, which is a key factor influencing amphibian habitat suitability (Rittenhouse et al., 2008). Areas with low variability indicate more stable and consistently moist conditions, whereas high variability represents fluctuating moisture levels that can increase desiccation risk for amphibians.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **3. Standardisation**\n",
    "The resulting raster was standardised to a **0–1 range** to ensure comparability with other predictors used in the SDM. Standardisation improves model performance by ensuring all predictors contribute equally, regardless of their original value range (Phillips et al., 2006; Elith & Leathwick, 2009).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ecological Justification\n",
    "\n",
    "Temporal variability in soil moisture is a crucial predictor for amphibian habitat suitability because it influences the availability of suitable microhabitats for hydration, movement, and breeding. High variability can increase the risk of desiccation, reduce habitat connectivity, and limit amphibian dispersal (Ousterhout & Semlitsch, 2018). Including this predictor in SDM allows for a more nuanced understanding of how amphibians interact with their environment, particularly under changing climatic conditions.\n",

    "## 12. Distance to Rock-Gravel-Sand\n",
    "### Importance for Amphibians\n",
    "\n",
    "Surface-exposed **rocky**, **gravelly**, and **sandy areas** are critical for amphibians due to their role in providing microhabitats for **shelter**, **thermoregulation**, and **breeding**. Amphibians are highly sensitive to environmental conditions, and RGS areas can create unique microclimates that buffer against desiccation and extreme temperatures. These habitats also enhance **connectivity** by serving as stepping stones for movement across fragmented landscapes, improving population resilience (Rittenhouse et al., 2008; Ousterhout & Semlitsch, 2018).\n",
    "\n",
    "Including **distance to RGS areas** as a predictor in Species Distribution Modelling (SDM) helps account for the spatial influence of these features on amphibian habitat suitability.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Data Sources\n",
    "\n",
    "- **UKCEH Land Cover Map (LCM)**:  \n",
    "  High-resolution land cover data was used to identify surface-exposed RGS areas. Relevant classes (inland rock, supralittoral rock, supralittoral sediment, littoral rock, and littoral sediment) were extracted based on their ecological relevance to amphibians.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Source: [UKCEH Land Cover Map 2022](https://catalogue.ceh.ac.uk/documents/7823d1f6-36c6-48dc-a74e-62c4e5d8f055)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Process Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Step 1: Clipping the UKCEH Land Cover Map**  \n",
    "The UKCEH Land Cover Map was clipped to the study area boundary in central Scotland to focus on relevant habitat features.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Step 2: Reclassifying Relevant Land Cover Classes**  \n",
    "A reclassification was performed using the **Reclassify** tool in ArcGIS Pro to assign a value of **1** to the following classes:\n",
    "- Inland Rock\n",
    "- Supralittoral Rock\n",
    "- Supralittoral Sediment\n",
    "- Littoral Rock\n",
    "- Littoral Sediment  \n",
    "All other classes were assigned **NoData** to exclude them from further analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Step 3: Calculating Distance to Nearest RGS Area**  \n",
    "The **Euclidean Distance** tool was used to calculate the nearest distance from each raster cell to an RGS area. This resulted in a continuous raster layer where each cell value represents the distance to the closest RGS feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Step 4: Standardising the Distance Raster**  \n",
    "The distance raster was standardised to a **0–1 range** using the formula:\n",
    "```plaintext\n",
    "Standardised value = (Distance - Min Distance) / (Max Distance - Min Distance)\n",
    "```\n",
    "This ensures that the layer is comparable with other predictors used in the SDM. Values close to **0** represent areas near RGS features, while values close to **1** represent areas farther away.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Rationale for Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "### Selection of RGS Features\n",
    "The selected classes (rocky and sandy habitats) represent surface-exposed areas critical to amphibian habitat use. Including these features ensures that the SDM accounts for microhabitat availability and spatial variability in habitat quality (Beebee & Griffiths, 2005).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Distance Calculation\n",
    "Distance to key habitat features is commonly used in SDMs as a proxy for habitat accessibility and suitability (Elith & Leathwick, 2009). By calculating the distance to RGS areas, this layer quantifies the spatial influence of these habitats on amphibian distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Standardisation\n",
    "Standardising the distance raster ensures consistency across predictors and facilitates model convergence by placing all variables on a comparable scale (Phillips et al., 2006).\n",
