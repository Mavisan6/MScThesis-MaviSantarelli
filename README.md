# MSc Thesis: Strategic Planning for Blue-Green Infrastructure: A GIS Approach to Amphibian Conservation in Urban and Peri-Urban Areas of Central Scotland

## Repository Overview

This repository contains the following components:

- **Jupyter Notebooks**: Detailed analysis and visualizations of amphibian habitat connectivity using species distribution models (SDMs), habitat suitability models, and ecological connectivity modeling.
- **Python Scripts**: Implementation of methodologies including Scikit-learn for machine learning, MaxEnt for SDMs, and Circuitscape for ecological connectivity modeling.
- **Data**: Datasets used for the analysis, including species trait information and environmental variables.
- **Documentation**: Descriptions of the methodology, results, and interpretations.

## Key Features

- **Multidimensional Trait Analysis**: Analysis of six amphibian species (Common Toad, Palmate Newt, Smooth Newt, Common Frog, Great Crested Newt, and Alpine Newt) to evaluate habitat connectivity.
- **Blue-Green Infrastructure Evaluation**: Identification of BGI opportunities to enhance amphibian corridors and connectivity.
- **Transparency and Reproducibility**: All code and data are available for review and replication, following best practices for reproducible research.
